# PREDICTING-STUDENT-PERFORMANCE-REAL-TIME

This project aims to predict student performance in real-time during game-based learning using one of the largest open datasets of game logs. The goal is to advance research into knowledge-tracing methods for game-based learning, helping developers create more effective educational games and providing educators with dashboards and analytic tools. Although game-based learning is becoming increasingly popular, there are limited open datasets available to apply data science and learning analytic principles. The Field Day Lab, a publicly-funded research lab, designs educational games for various subjects and age groups, making use of game data to understand how people learn. The lab partners with nonprofits like The Learning Agency Lab to develop the science of learning-based tools and programs for the social good.
